# The-Useless-Terminal
This is a compilation of interesting and entertaining scripts compiled into one batch script called the linux terminal. I made this as a bored 14 year old and I hope someone can enjoy it as much as I do! :)

# Extended Description
I designed this program to help me along on my journey to learning how to become a hacker. As a 14 year old I had some basic programming knowledge and compiled tools that were simmilar to the ones I was learning how to use. The functionality on the majority of the tool's are non-existant or very questionable, with the exception of some scripts I developed that are actually pretty cool and usefull. All together there exists 75 different interactive tool's within the program including some easter eggs and a bit of sloppyness contrived from my lack of a goal for the "linux terminal."

What does this program do you may ask. This program has some working features out of the 75 tool's around 30 still work! For the other 45 tool's they either never worked from the start (designed for looks), they worked at one time and the API key or website that allow that tool to work has gone offline, a windows update or firewall update is blocking functionality. The majority of the program was coded in batch and if you understand batch then you can always look to see how to interact with the tools or modify the program to your liking.

# Installation
To install the linux terminal amd have it working the way it was designed you must
- First place the dependincies directly in your C drive.
- Next right click on the Linux Terminal.bat file and select edit to view the code. (This will be your guide as there are no instructions for the program)
- Navigate to lines 41 - 66 it will look like this

- The command to the right of the == are valid commands you can input on the main screen after booting the program
- Navigate to lines 149 - 203 it will look like this
![c2](https://github.com/Matrix07ksa/Brute_Force/assets/149164084/b499379d-350f-4ca3-8f34-4470f89a46d6)
![c3](https://github.com/Matrix07ksa/Brute_Force/assets/149164084/bc583abb-ef48-496b-b331-e2fdd44b8986)
- The commands after the == are valid commands you can you can input in the 'shell' (you can get to the shell by typing shell on after the boot screen!)
- Let's say you want to test the cookiestealer tool in the shell first you would type cookiestealer and be brought to an input with little context
- To see correct input for cookiestealer find cookiestealer in the code like this

- Next look and see what is to the right of 'goto' and that will be where you need to navigate in the code to locate that tool's script
![t2](https://github.com/Matrix07ksa/Brute_Force/assets/149164084/da8c9143-4114-448a-820e-c291dd336c19)

- Now if you want to find the correct input just look for the 'if something == something goto something' and that will be the valid commands you can input to advance through the tool

- That is all you need to get the program working to it's current fullest ability.
